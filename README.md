# Regression-Techniques
This project involves predicting month-wise temperatures in India using linear regression. The dataset, obtained from Kaggle, includes average monthly temperatures recorded in Celsius. The analysis includes data preparation using Pandas and NumPy, applying linear regression with Scikit-learn, and assessing the model's performance using Mean Squared Error (MSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and R-Square metrics. Additionally, the project visualizes the regression model with Matplotlib to illustrate the prediction accuracy. This project showcases practical machine learning applications for temperature prediction and performance evaluation.
